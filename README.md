# A Simple Game of Tic-Tac-Toe
A console version of a tic-tac-toe program made for Codecademy's open-ended functions challenge project in C++.
The steps were a simple arrangement of requirements that the programmer needed to meet, 
then utilize loops, vectors, and functions in order to make the game work for two players.
The code can theoretically work for any size board (with some heavy adjustments to the tttf.cpp file).
